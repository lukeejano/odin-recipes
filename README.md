# odin-recipes
A small website for The Odin Project. Can't wait to add CSS or maybe even a brutalist design.
My project will consist of a index page, and 3 other linkable pages, contain recipes.
I think my Odin Recipes project is going pretty well, at this moment in my course, I can't use any CSS so making it look good is proving to be a challenge.
I have completed my assignment how ever, I have also linked back to all sources.
